## 🚀 26 in 26 — A Year of Building 🚀

26 projects. 26 two-week cycles. One year of deep engineering.

This organization is [my](https://github.com/TalDebby) 2026 personal challenge:
to design and build 26 meaningful coding projects, each developed over two consecutive weeks, with an emphasis on learning, exploration, and real engineering trade-offs.

## 🗓 How This Works
Each project lives in its own repository and follows the same rhythm:

### Week 1 — Design & Exploration

- Problem definition
- Architecture & trade-off analysis
- Technology and approach selection
- Mini POC / experiments
- Clear goals for implementation

### Week 2 — Implementation

- Core functionality
- Real constraints and edge cases
- Testing and iteration
- Documentation and learnings

This structure keeps things ambitious without rushing — every project starts with thinking before typing.

## 🧠 What Kind of Projects?

The scope is intentionally wide. Topics include (but are not limited to):

- 🧩 Low-level systems
  * shells
  * memory management
  * schedulers
- 🎮 Physics engines & simulations
- 💻 Web apps
  * useful, weird, or just fun
- 🤖 LLMs & ML from scratch
  * tokenizers
  * transformers
  * training loops
- 🗄 Databases & storage systems
  * custom DBs
  * indexing
  * replication
- 🌐 Networkin infrastructure
  * load balancers
  * queues
  * distributed systems
- 📱 Mobile apps


Some projects will be polished.
Others will be raw, experimental, or opinionated — and that’s intentional.

## 💡 Project Ideas Are Welcome

Have an idea you think would be interesting, painful, or educational? <br> 
Just open an issue | start a Discussion | drop a suggestion in a repo

Ideas can be big, small, theoretical, or impractical.
If it teaches something — it belongs here.

## 🤝 Collaboration Welcome

This is a personal challenge — not a closed one.

Want to co-design a system? | Implement a feature? | Stress-test assumptions? | Review architecture decisions?

You’re welcome to: Open PRs, Suggest improvements, Join a project mid-cycle, Build a parallel implementation, Learning is better when it’s shared.

## 📚 Philosophy
- **Design matters** as much as code
- Constraints make things interesting
- “From scratch” is a learning tool, not a religion
- **Shipping beats perfection**
- Curiosity > polish

## 🔚 Why 26?

Two weeks per project.
A full year.
Enough time to go deep — not enough to get comfortable.

Let’s build.
